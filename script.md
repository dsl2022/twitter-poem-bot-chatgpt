Hey there, are you ready to learn how to generate random poems using code and OpenAI? Great! Let's get started.

First things first, let's talk about OpenAI. It's a research organization that's all about developing and promoting friendly artificial intelligence. And the best part? They offer a range of API's that allow us to use their machine learning models for all sorts of tasks, like text generation.

So, how do we get started with OpenAI? Simple! Just create a free account on their website and grab an API key. This key will be your ticket to making API requests to OpenAI's servers.

Now, let's dive into the code. First, we'll import a few libraries that we'll need. The os library will help us access our API key from our environment variables, the openai library will allow us to make API requests, and the dotenv library will help us load our environment variables from a .env file.

Next, we'll use the load_dotenv function to load our environment variables and the os.getenv function to retrieve our API key. We'll then assign this key to the openai.api_key variable so we can use it in our API requests.

Now for the fun part! We'll use the openai.Completion.create function to generate a poem. We'll pass in several parameters to control the model, the prompt, and the style and tone of the generated text.

Finally, we'll retrieve the generated poem from the response object and assign it to the poem_hashtags variable. And voila! We can print this variable to see our shiny new poem.

That's all there is to it! You now know how to generate random poems using code and OpenAI. I hope you found this tutorial helpful and energizing. Thanks for watching!
